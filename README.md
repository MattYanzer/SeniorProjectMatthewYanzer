# SeniorProjectMatthewYanzer
This is my senior project after ditching Unreal Engine
Bear in mind that while running the project, the addresses finding the sprite files will need to be changed to reflect where you decide to store them on your PC. That way, the program can find and reference the sprites. I do not believe the console application files need to be included, just the .spr files, the .cpp files, and the .h file. It is also important to note that this project was compiled in Visual Studio 2017 as a console application. In order to run the project, it may be necessary to start a console application on Visual Studio and import the files for the program to be runnable.
